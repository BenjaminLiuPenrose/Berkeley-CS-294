Section 3: Steps:
1) DQN - Question 1 - basic Q-learning performance
    python run_dqn_atari.py
2) Question 2 - double Q-learning
    python run_dqn_atari.py (change param in file run_dqn_atari.py double_q to True)
3) Question 3 - experimenting with hyperparamsters
    python run_dqn_atari.py (change param gamma in file run_dqn_atari.py gamma to different values)
4) AC - Question 1 - Sanity check with Cartpole
    sh actorcritic.bash
5) Question 2 - Run actor-critic with more difficult tasks
    sh actorcritic.bash

6) read report files - file start with 3034330004 [.pdf][.html][.md]
optional) run the main program by
	python run_dqn_atari.py ...
    python run_dqn_ram.py ...
	python train_ac_f18.py ...
