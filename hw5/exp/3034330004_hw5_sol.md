# Advanced Exploration
## Problem 1 - Hist Exploration
#### The reward modification (Eqn. 1), the count-based reward bonus (Eqn. 2), and the histogram density model
- A plot with 2 curves comparing an agent with histogrambased exploration and an agent with no exploration

## Problem 2 - RBF Exploration
#### The heuristic reward bonus (Eqn. 2), and the kernel density estimator with the radial basis function kernel.
- A plot with 2 curves comparing an agent with KDEbased exploration and an agent with no exploration

## Problem 3 - EX2 Exploration
- A plot with 2 curves comparing an agent with EX2-based exploration and an agent with no exploration

## Problem 4 - EX2 Exploration, Hyper-params
- A plot with 3 curves comparing the agents with EX2-based exploration and an agent with no exploration

- Short answer: Compare the two learning curves for EX2 and hypothesize a possible reason for (1) the shape of each learning curve and (2) the difference in performance between the learning curves.
